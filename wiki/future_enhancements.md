# Future Enhancements and Considerations

This document outlines potential areas for future development and improvement of this library.

## Advanced Denoising Techniques

*   **Multiway Principal Component Analysis (MP-PCA) / Tensor Decomposition:**
    *   **Concept:** Explore the use of tensor decomposition methods (e.g., Tucker Decomposition, PARAFAC/CANDECOMP) for dMRI denoising or feature extraction. These methods can model the multi-dimensional structure of dMRI data more holistically than patch-based 2D PCA.
    *   **Potential Benefits:** Could offer improved noise reduction, better separation of signal components, or extraction of physically meaningful parameters by leveraging the inherent tensor nature of dMRI (e.g., Space x Space x Space x Gradient_Direction x Shell_b-value).
    *   **Implementation Details:** Would likely involve using libraries like TensorLy or implementing custom Alternating Least Squares (ALS) or similar optimization algorithms in PyTorch.
    *   **References:** Kolda and Bader (2009), "Tensor Decompositions and Applications," SIAM Review (arXiv:0707.1451) is a good starting point.
