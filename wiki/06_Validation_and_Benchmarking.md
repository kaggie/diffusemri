# 06: Validation and Benchmarking

Ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and performance of diffusion MRI models and processing tools is crucial for research and clinical applications. The `diffusemri` library incorporates several validation strategies and provides guidance for users interested in performing their own benchmarking studies.

## Validation Strategies within the Library

The library's development includes a focus on verifying the correctness of its implementations:

*   **Synthetic Data Tests:**
    *   **Purpose:** The internal test suite (located in the `tests/` directory) extensively uses synthetically generated dMRI data to validate the model fitting procedures and the accuracy of parameter estimation.
    *   **Methodology:** For models like DTI and NODDI, synthetic signals are created with known ground truth parameters (e.g., specific FA, MD, NDI, ODI values, and fiber orientations). The models are then fitted to this synthetic data, often under various simulated noise conditions. The estimated parameters are subsequently compared against the known ground truths to ensure the implementations are accurate and robust.
    *   **Coverage:** These tests aim to cover a range of parameter values and typical acquisition scenarios.

*   **Cross-Model Consistency:**
    *   **Purpose:** Where applicable, efforts are made to ensure that parameter estimates are consistent across different models or implementations when analyzing simple, well-defined conditions.
    *   **Example:** For instance, in simple single-fiber configurations, the mean neurite orientation estimated by the custom PyTorch-based NODDI model can be compared against the principal eigenvector from a DTI fit to the same data. Such comparisons help verify the coherence of different parts of the library.

## Benchmarking Guidance

For users who wish to perform more extensive comparisons of the `diffusemri` library's model implementations (especially custom ones like the PyTorch-based NODDI) against other software packages, alternative algorithms, or more comprehensive ground truth datasets, specific guidance is provided.

*   **Detailed Guide:** A dedicated document, `docs/benchmarking_noddi.md` (relative to the repository root), offers detailed strategies and considerations for benchmarking the NODDI model implementation. Many of the principles discussed in this guide can also be applied to other models.
*   **Key Aspects Covered in the Guide (and general benchmarking advice):**
    *   **Synthetic Data Benchmarking:** How to generate robust synthetic datasets with varying levels of complexity (e.g., single fibers, crossing fibers, different noise levels) and appropriate ground truths.
    *   **Real Data Comparisons:** Strategies for comparing model fits on real-world dMRI datasets, including considerations for data quality, preprocessing, and selection of regions of interest.
    *   **Metrics for Comparison:** Suggests relevant metrics for comparing model performance, such as accuracy of parameter estimates, goodness-of-fit, computational speed, and robustness to noise.
    *   **Important Considerations:** Highlights factors that can influence benchmark results, such as differences in model assumptions, fitting algorithms, default parameters, and software environments. Ensuring fair and informative comparisons is emphasized.

Users are encouraged to consult `docs/benchmarking_noddi.md` and consider these validation principles when applying the `diffusemri` library in their research.
