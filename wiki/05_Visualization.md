# 05: Basic Visualization

Visualizing diffusion MRI data and the parameter maps derived from models is essential for quality control, analysis, and interpretation. The `diffusemri` library primarily focuses on data processing and model fitting, with results (like parameter maps or streamlines) typically saved in standard file formats (e.g., NIFTI, TRK). These can then be visualized using a variety of dedicated neuroimaging software packages (e.g., MRtrix's `mrview`, FSLeyes, Slicer, TrackVis).

However, this document outlines basic visualization approaches that can be achieved using common Python tools or specific functionalities if available within the library.

## Displaying 2D Slices of Parameter Maps

Parameter maps generated by this library (such as FA, MD, NDI, ODI, etc.) are typically produced as 3D NumPy arrays. These can be easily visualized slice-by-slice using standard Python plotting libraries like Matplotlib.

*   **Method:**
    1.  Load or generate a parameter map (e.g., an FA map from DTI fitting). This will be a 3D NumPy array.
    2.  Use Matplotlib's `imshow` function to display a specific slice along a chosen axis (axial, sagittal, or coronal).
*   **Example (using Matplotlib):**
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Assume 'parameter_map' is a 3D NumPy array (e.g., an FA map)
    # For example, loaded from a NIFTI file or generated by a model fitting function.
    # parameter_map = load_my_fa_map_function("path/to/fa_map.nii.gz") 
    
    # Create dummy parameter map for demonstration
    map_shape = (64, 64, 32) # X, Y, Z dimensions
    parameter_map = np.random.rand(map_shape[0], map_shape[1], map_shape[2]).astype(np.float32)
    parameter_map[28:36, 28:36, 14:18] = 0.8 # Simulate a region of high FA
    
    # Display an axial slice (e.g., slice index 15 from the Z-axis)
    slice_index_z = map_shape[2] // 2
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
    plt.imshow(parameter_map[:, :, slice_index_z].T, cmap='gray', origin='lower', aspect='equal')
    plt.colorbar(label="Parameter Value")
    plt.title(f"Axial Slice (Z = {slice_index_z}) of Parameter Map")
    plt.xlabel("X-axis")
    plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
    # The plt.show() command will open a new window to display the plot.
    # In some environments (like Jupyter notebooks), plots might appear inline.
    # To make this example fully runnable, ensure Matplotlib is installed (`pip install matplotlib`).
    plt.show()
    
    print("Matplotlib example complete. A plot window should have appeared if run in a suitable environment.")
    ```

## GUI for Multi-Tissue CSD Maps

The user's original library description mentioned: "GUI allows selection of different output maps from MT-CSD for visualization."

*   **Functionality:** If the `diffusemri` library includes a dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI), it may offer interactive ways to explore data, select and display different parameter maps (particularly from complex models like Multi-Tissue CSD which can produce several output maps like WM fODFs, GM, and CSF volume fractions).
*   **Accessing the GUI:** (Details would depend on the specific library implementation)
    *   It might be a standalone application launched from the command line.
    *   There might be a specific function within the library to launch it (e.g., `diffusemri.gui.launch_viewer()`).
*   **Usage:** Users would typically load their processed data or model fit results into the GUI to view different maps, adjust display settings, and navigate through slices.

*   **Note:** As the specific implementation details or public API for launching/interacting with such a GUI are not fully detailed here, users should refer to the main library documentation or specific GUI module instructions if this feature is central to their workflow. For general-purpose viewing of NIFTI files produced by this library, external viewers are also highly recommended.

## Visualizing Tractography Streamlines

Streamlines generated by the tractography module (e.g., `diffusemri.tracking.deterministic.track_deterministic_oudf()`) are typically saved in formats like `.trk`. These files can be visualized using specialized software such as:

*   **MRtrix (`mrview`)**
*   **TrackVis**
*   **DIPY Horizon (Dipy's own visualization tools)**
*   **Slicer**

These tools allow for 3D rendering of streamlines, coloring by orientation or other metrics, filtering, and overlaying on anatomical images.
