However, due to the external dependency on FSL and the complexity of input data required, this notebook will primarily focus on explaining the concepts and showing **conceptual examples** of how to use these wrappers and their corresponding CLI commands. **Actual execution of these FSL tools is not performed within this notebook.**"

        "1.  A working FSL installation with tools in your system PATH.\n",

        "3.  Accurate `acqparams.txt` and `index.txt` files that correctly describe your dMRI acquisition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Always refer to the official FSL documentation for the most detailed and up-to-date information on these tools and their parameters. The examples in this notebook are intended to show *how* the `diffusemri` wrappers are called, rather than being a directly runnable end-to-end pipeline without user-specific data."
