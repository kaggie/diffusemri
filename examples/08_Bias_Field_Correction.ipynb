        "**What is Bias Field?**\n",
        "A bias field (also known as intensity non-uniformity or INU) is a low-frequency, spatially varying artifact that affects MR images. It causes the intensity of the same tissue type to vary across the image, which can negatively impact quantitative analysis, segmentation, and registration.\n",
        "\n",
        "**N4 Bias Field Correction**\n",
        "The N4 (N3 followed by B-spline fitting) algorithm is a popular method for correcting bias fields. It is an iterative method that models the bias field as a smooth multiplicative field. Dipý provides access to N4 implementations (often relying on ITK components, potentially via SimpleITK, or its own DeepN4 variant)."
