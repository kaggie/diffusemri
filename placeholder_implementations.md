# Placeholder Implementations Log

This file tracks the implementation of any functions or classes that were initially identified as placeholders or required significant enhancements to meet their intended functionality as described in the project scope.

*(No placeholders explicitly marked as 'Placeholder - Not Implemented' or 'Placeholder - Basic Functionality' were found during the `features.md` audit in Step 2 of Phase 1. This file is created to log any such work if it arises during later stages or deeper review.)*
